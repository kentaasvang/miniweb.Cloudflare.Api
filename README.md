# üÜï miniweb.Cloudflare.Api

## ‚ùì Simple REST-api for updating records on Cloudflare
It's not a good idea to expose these endpoints to the internet. It's made to be used internally on a private server and thus have no authentication.

## ‚ö° Getting Started
Configure user-secrets with e-mail and global api-key from cloudflare, then you should be good to go.
```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "Cloudflare:Email" "your@email.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "Cloudflare:ApiKey" "your-api-key"
```

## üîß Building and Running on Ubuntu
You need an Ubuntuserver with .NET 6 SDK installed
Publish you application as self-contained and move release files to suitable location on you ubuntu-server. Generally `/opt` is a good choice.

**Create Unit-file in `/etc/systemd/system/cloudflareapi.service`**
